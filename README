# ExposureRadar

ExposureRadar is a full-stack platform to manage attack surface and asset exposure for security teams.  
This repository is a **local-only, portfolio-focused monorepo** containing:

- A backend API (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Redis).
- A frontend web app (React + Vite + TypeScript).
- Docker Compose setup for running the full stack locally.
- Basic CI pipelines (lint + tests) using GitHub Actions.

> Note: This project is designed for **local execution only** (no real production deployment).  
> Recruiters and reviewers can clone the repo, run Docker, and explore the app locally.

## Tech stack (high level)

- **Backend:** Node.js (NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma, BullMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, TanStack Query
- **Infrastructure (dev/portfolio):** Docker Compose, GitHub Actions

## Getting started

> This section will be completed as Phase 0 progresses.  
> For now, only the repository skeleton is in place.

Planned flow for a reviewer (once Phase 0 is complete):

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure local `.env` files.
3. Run `docker compose up --build`.
4. Run Prisma migrations and seed demo data.
5. Open:
   - `http://localhost:4000/health` for the API healthcheck.
   - `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.
   - `/debug/health` page in the frontend to see a UI-driven healthcheck.

## Documentation

More technical documentation will be added under `docs/`:

- Data model (domain entities and database schema).
- API contracts and error model.
- Architecture and quality guidelines.
